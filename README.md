My name is Robert

Since my first project in  [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), I have liked the idea of programming and creating something out of my imagination.\
Later, when I started working in companies that relied on machines, I was fascinated by how they worked.

Especially in the medical industry,\
where machines had visual input and could decide in less than a second\
which product was good to go and which was not.\
And at that moment I chose to become a programmer.

I signed up for the Python Developer course and I successfully completed it,\
and additionally, in March, I took part in a certified SCRUM course.

I would love to understand many programming languages, be able to program anything one day, even hardware
